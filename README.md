# Welcome
This is for Team-Newton of Hack-Bio internship, 2020.  
# Overview
This image contains the overall step-to-step guide on what the task entails.  
# How to
<!--**N.B: This is what is called baby-steps. This should suffice for now.**  -->
## Step 1
The first thing, as you may have guessed, is to create a github account [here](https://github.com). Create a repository, give it a name (your slack ID, preferably). Make it a public one and check the box asking to create a readme (that's what you're reading).  
## Step 2
You can edit and populate your readme file right on your browser. You can also create a new file and paste your code in it. You're creating this repo., because it's advisable you have a copy of your script/code on your repo.
## Step 3
Aside editing on your browser, you can download the repo. as a zip file onto your PC.  If you can afford to download git *note: git, not github* on to your PC, paste this code in to your command prompt/git bash to clone the team repo. For any other repo, change the URL.
```
git clone https://github.com/dEnchanter/Team-Newton.git
```
**N.B: If you have it installed, you can use Visual Studio Code to clone a repo. Ask Google, *'how to clone a repo using VS Code'*, for more information.**  
## Step 3
Wait for it to completely download the repository's content, create a file of yours and write your code in it - I'm sure you know the correct extension for the language you aim to write in.  On writing your code, the least you can use is your PC's notepad and the largest being VS Code. For this task, *"Programmers' notepad"* can suffice. Check Google on how to download that.
